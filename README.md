# Dual-Mode-Robotic-Arm-with-Mimic-control-and-Object-Detection
The aim of this project is to develop a dual-functionality robotic arm that can switch between manual control  using a smaller arm with potentiometers and an automated mode that utilizes computer vision  for object detection and autonomous operation.
