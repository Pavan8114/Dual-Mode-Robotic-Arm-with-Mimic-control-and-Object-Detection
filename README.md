# Dual-Mode-Robotic-Arm-with-Mimic-control-and-Object-Detection
In many industries, there is a need for robotic systems that can offer both precise manual control and autonomous operation. Traditional robotic arms are limited in flexibility, often confined to either manual or automated tasks. This project develops a dual-mode robotic arm that addresses this limitation. In manual mode, the arm mimics a user's movements using a smaller arm controller with potentiometers for precise control. In automated mode, it uses a deep learning-based object detection system to identify and pick up objects autonomously. This dual functionality enhances efficiency, adaptability, and user control, making the robotic arm suitable for various applications.
